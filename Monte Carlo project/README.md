## Monte Carlo simulation in trading is nothing but house of cards

Why do I put this picture (see <a href=https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/2048:_Curve-Fitting>here</a> for more details) right in front of everything? Have I caught your attention? Hopefully I have. These days, blogs of data science topic are dime a dozen. Some blogs teach you how to use decision tree/random forrest to predict the stock price movement, others illustrate the possibility of back-propagation neural network to forecast a bond price. The brutal truth is, most of them are house of cards. 

Monte Carlo, my first thought on these two words is that grand casino, where you meet Famke Janssen and introduce yourself 'Bond, James Bond'.
