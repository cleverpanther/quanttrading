# Oil money project

As I mentioned before, this is a project inspired by an article that i read. During low volatility period, the article recommended to trade Norwegian Krone as the oil price was bouncing back. To my curiosity, I intended to find out if this idea is plausible. First thing came to my mind was whether the correlation between Norwegian Krone and Brent Crude was substantial. Norway is one my fav places in Europe. Unlike Qatar or Saudi or any other gulf countries, it doesnt heavily rely on oil for its gross income. I doubted oil would be the only factor that affects the exchange rate of NOK. I looked into trading statistics of Norway. Basically, most trading partners are in European Union. Prior to stats, I included UK sterling and Euro in my linear regression model. To my surprise, Norway is actually doing a lot of business with US. Thus, the model consisted of EUR, GBP, USD and Brent Crude.

The regression result came out as below.We had a pretty high R square. All T stats and F stats were significant. As the summary suggested, there could be multicollinearity. I wouldnt doubt it as Brent Crude and USD should be negatively correlated.

In this case, we could use elastic net regression to implement a penalty function on this multicollinearity problem. Elastic net is a statistics/machine learning technique that consists of Lasso and Ridge regression (more details can be found from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastic_net_regularization ). Lets take elastic net estimated NOK to subtract from OLS estimated NOK. From the figure below, we could tell the distribution of the difference is negatively skewed which implied OLS overestimated NOK.

The next step, we take the residuals from both estimations and check its standard deviation. It turns out that elastic net regression delivers a smaller standard deviation. Now we could determine OLS estimation was biased and elastic net estimation would be the better answer. Before signal generation, we ought to set up thresholds. For common practise in statistical arbitrage, we take one sigma away from our fitted value as thresholds. When actual NOK price goes above the upper threshold, we take a short position cuz we hold the belief that it would come back to its so called normal status. For lower threshold scenario, its vice versa. However, the model is based on historical data. Our estimation is most likely to be overfitting. We need to set up other thresholds for stop orders. When the model doesnt work any more, we would clear our positions and exit the trades. We would use the statistical golden rule, 2 sigmas with 95% confidence interval, to do the trick. If NOK deviates 2 sigmas away from our fitted value, we will reverse our positions and get outta there while we can. The figures below are positions prior to our signal generations and the price movement against our fitted value.
